Installation and Updates

Installation
============

You can install an addon `in a standard way <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#installing-add-ons>`_. There is nothing complicated here ðŸ˜‰

Updates
=======

Everything is a little more complicated here, but not much. Obviously, most users only installing an addon once, after updating the Blender, and then when the current version stops working on newer or from some sources learns about new critical features. This addon has its own update system for users who do not use Git.

The updates are checked automatically when you open the Blender (don't worry, this is a background process, so it does not interfere with work). If the system detects an update, a message will appear in the user interface:

.. image:: ./images/update-available.jpg
    :align: center

If you click on it then information about the update would appear:

.. image:: ./images/update-info.jpg
    :align: center

The upgrade is also in the standard method, but automatically:

.. image:: ./images/update-installed.jpg
    :align: center

Other update systems modify current files, instead the previous version will simply be disabled but will not be changed or deleted any files:

.. image:: ./images/update-versions.jpg
    :align: center

That is, if for some reason you want to return to the previous version, you must turn off the updated and only then - turn on the previous.
