Configure UDIM
==============

The add-on uses some standard methods for importing, but in certain situations this creates incorrect data for the add-on to work with. If this option is activated, after importing the object, the materials for working with UDIM textures will be set, and after selecting the canvas, the image settings will be checked and adjusted
