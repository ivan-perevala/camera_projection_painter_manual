"**In the github description you say \"you can adjust the texture and camera data\", what do you mean by that? I'm "
"interested in what this addon is, but it's hard to piece the meaning together from the descriptions**"
msgstr ""

msgid "It allows you to paint over the texture of the reconstructed object with a clone brush from the original photo."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Does it support multicamera rigs with images of different w x h sizes ?**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yes, it supports.  Here, of course, it should be noted that the sensor of imported cameras matters, and this will "
"affect whether the distortion of the lens will be correctly calculated, because Blender strictly separates the "
"height and width of the sensor, but the import operators automatically set its value. But yes, working with "
"different image resolutions is one of the main purposes of the add-on. For example, if a camera with the largest "
"resolution is installed vertically in the facial rig and is aimed directly at the face, it makes sense to add "
"details from it"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Can you input intrinsics via file?**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yes, I can and you probably can too üòâ I've also written some documentation for the add-on, so I think that might "
"help."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But in general yes, of course you can import/export internal/external parameters of cameras - this significantly "
"reduces the size of the data needed to work with the scan texture."
