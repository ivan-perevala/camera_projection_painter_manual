Quick access to addon user preferences.

Obviously, the operator itself does not make much sense, since the custom settings are not difficult to reach in the usual way, but during operation it may be necessary to disable or enable some options, for example :ref:`Use Mesh Preview` or :ref:`Use Previews` will continue to work in this mode. It is also worth noting that in the user settings there is a link to the folder with the addon logs, which can tell a lot about a possible issue, so it will also help to get the current log faster and fix the situation.
