Create New Canvas
#################

Available during the :doc:`canvas selection setup stage <ensure-canvas>`. This is a simple operator to create a new canvas with a size of 2048x2048 pixels. It can be used if there is no exported texture.

To be fair, this operator allows to bypass certain limitations of the standard image creation operator, and its use is not mission-critical, but it can still be used in certain non-standard workflows.
